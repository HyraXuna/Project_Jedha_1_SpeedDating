# Project_Jedha_1_SpeedDating
The 1st project for the Jedha Data science &amp; engineering certification

In this jupyter notebook, there will be the answers of the questions for this project; \ with the statistical description, visualisations and captions and interpretations; \ that will be the following (in the idea):

* What are the least desirable attributes in a male partner? Does this differ for female partners?
* How important do people think attractiveness is in potential mate selection vs. its real impact?
* Are shared interests more important than a shared racial background?
* Can people accurately predict their own perceived value in the dating market?
* In terms of getting a second date, is it better to be someone's first speed date of the night or their last?
